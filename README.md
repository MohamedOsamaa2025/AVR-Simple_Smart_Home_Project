# AVR-Simple_Smart_Home_Project


Simple Smart Home is a simulation-based embedded system that combines access 
control, temperature monitoring, and safety features. Designed and tested using Proteus, 
the system includes a temperature sensor (LM35), DC motor (fan), keypad, LCD, LED, and 
push buttons for emergency and lockdown functions. It begins in a locked state and 
requires correct passcode entry to operate. Once active, the fan responds dynamically to 
temperature levels. Emergency and lockdown scenarios prompt re-authentication to 
maintain secure system behavior.
